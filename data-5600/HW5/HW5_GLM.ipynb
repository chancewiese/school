    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, the analytics website, FiveThirtyEight, published an analysis of the gender disparity in appearances in comic books at the two large studios, Marvel and DC. You're working for a small upstart comic book company and you want to work to understand what characteristics are associated with a reduction in appearances and thereby learn where gaps in representation can be filled by your firm. Using the data collected by FiveThirtyEight from the Marvel and DC wiki pages, you will fit an appropriate GLM to predict the number of appearances given this data.\n",
